data_inputs: incident flu hospitalizations
methods_long: 'Tncidence, the median prediction at all future horizons
  is the most recent observed weekly incidence.  To get a distribution around
  the median, we look at how much incidence has changed from week to week in
  the past, and we allow for the possibility that similar changes will occur
  again in the future.

  In more technical detail, forecasts of incidence are generated through the
  following procedure: 1) Calculate first differences of incidence; 2) Collect
  all first differences and their negatives; 3) Sample first differences in
  incidence and add to the most recent observed incidence; 4) Enforce that the
  mean of the predictive distribution for incidence is equal to the most recent
  observed incidence; 5) truncate the predictive distribution for incidence at
  0.'
