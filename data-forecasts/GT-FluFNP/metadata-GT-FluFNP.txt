methods_long: Jan 10, 2022 - "This data-driven deep learning model learns stochastic dependencies \
 \ between various data sequences projected in a latent space via neural Gaussian processes. \ 
 \ Therefore, it leverages the expressive power of deep sequential models along with \
 \ non-parametric neural models to learn a non-parametric distribution of forecast as \
 \ functional over past sequences. The data sequences used are syndromic, demographic, \ 
 \ mobility and clinical data."
