methods: A VAR model that groups together state-level hospiliization trajectories due to influenza and COVID-19, probabilistically selects the number of lags from 1 to 5, and is fit with stan.
team_funding:
data_inputs: HHS confirmed influenza hospitilizations, and HHS confirmed COVID-19 hosptilizations at the state level and aggregated to weeks. The model trains on data from epidemic week 2021W01 and forward.
