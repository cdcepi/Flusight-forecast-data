methods_long: 'Model forecasts are obtained by using a renewal equation based on the estimated net reproduction number Rt. To estimate Rt, we inferred the daily number of hospitalization by using a spline interpolation of the weekly trend in the hospitalization data. We then used MCMC Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of Rt based on the interpolated data, considering an informed prior on Rt based on influenza literature. Finally, Rt used in the renewal equation is based on a the posterior distribution and trend of the estimated Rt in the three most recent weeks of influenza data. '
