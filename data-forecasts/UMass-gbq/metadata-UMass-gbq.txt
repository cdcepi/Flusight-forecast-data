methods: 'Gradient boosting for the median, followed by conformal prediction to get quantiles'
methods_long: 'Bagged gradient boosting is used to obtain a predictive median.
  Features include the day of week, location, population, and summaries of time
  series behavior. Quantiles are obtained via a procedure similar to split
  conformal prediction, where quantiles of the out-of-bag residuals are added to
  the point predictions obtained from gradient boosting. Forecasts are created
  at the daily scale, and then aggregated to weekly. Model training is done
  jointly for COVID-19 and influenza hospitalizations.'
data_inputs: HHS Protect hospitalization data via COVIDcast.
