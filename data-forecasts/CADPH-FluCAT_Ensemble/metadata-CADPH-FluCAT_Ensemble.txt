team_model_designation: primary
methods: This model is an ensemble of several time series forecasting and predictive models targeting influenza hospital admits based on historical clinical lab and public health lab flu surveillance data.

team_funding: The views and opinions expressed by the authors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of the California Department of Public Health or the California Health and Human Services Agency.
data_inputs: Models are trained and validated on either historical flu hospitalization data (pre-COVID-19 pandemic, prior to 2020-2021 from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information) or current flu hospitalization data (including the 2020-2021 flu season, California Hospital Association/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).

methods_long: "Individual forecasts consist of combinations of two time-series forecast approaches, two model types, and two training/validation data sets. The two time series approaches that are used to generate four-week projections for each of the Clinical Lab, Public Health Lab, and influenza-like illness (ILI) data streams include: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), which uses a weighted linear sum of recent past observations or lags, and exponential smoothing (ETS), which uses weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. Next, predictive, autoregressive models are generated where the future flu hospital admits depend on current and past values of flu surveillance data and their interactions. The two model types used are: linear regression (LM) and random forest (RF). The resulting ensemble model is the median value of all eight individual forecasts."
