ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: An ensemble of multiple methods such as ARIMA (observation length optimized), Long short-term memory (lSTM) model, and piecewise-linear fit model.
methods_long: "This is a US national and state-level multi-method model forecasting the new influenza hospitalizations. Multiple methods include ARIMA trained using optimal observation length, LSTM model, and a piecewise-linear fit model to obtain trends. The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging."
