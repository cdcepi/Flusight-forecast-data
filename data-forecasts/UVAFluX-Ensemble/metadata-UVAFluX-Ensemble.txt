team_model_designation: primary
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: An ensemble of multiple methods such as ARIMA, Long short-term
  memory (lSTM) and piecewise-linear fit model.
methods_long: "This is a US national and state-level multi-method model
  forecasting the new influenza hospitalizations. Multiple methods include
  ARIMA (optimized for length of observed data), LSTM model, and
  piecewise-linear approximation model for trend projection. The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging."
