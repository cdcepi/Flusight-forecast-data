methods: An ensemble of multiple methods such as auto-regressive (AR) models with exogenous variables, ARIMA and Long short-term memory (lSTM) models.
methods_long: "This is a US national and state-level multi-method model forecasting the new influenza hospitalizations. Multiple methods include AR methods with exogenous variables such as other county case countstime-series,ARIMA and LSTM model. The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging."
