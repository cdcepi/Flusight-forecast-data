methods: An ensemble of multiple methods such as auto-regressive (AR) models with exogenous variables, ARIMA (observation length optimized), Long short-term memory (lSTM) models, and piece-wise linear approximation method.
methods_long: "This is a US national and state-level multi-method model forecasting the new influenza hospitalizations. Multiple methods include AR methods with exogenous variables such as other county case countstime-series,ARIMA, LSTM model, and piece-wise linear approximation method. The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging."
