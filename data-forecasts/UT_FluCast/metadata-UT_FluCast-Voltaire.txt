methods_long: "This is a state-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease\
  \  dynamics. This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters \
  \ and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social  distancing,\
  \ stay-at-home orders, and vaccine effects that reduce suspectibility and severity.\
  \ Infections are seeded stochastically with roughly 10\
  \ times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days of the epidemic\
  \ and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were  drawn stochastically for\
  \ each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting\
  \ data modulates the spread of disease within counties. \nStay-at-home orders and \
  \ subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according\
  \ to recent policy documents. Vaccination rates and reductions to the hospitalization\
  \ and mortality rates are state-specific by week. Ongoing NPIs continued through the remainder \
  \ of the simulation period, while vaccination coverage continues to increase slowly in\
  \ subsequent months until it reaches a maximum 90% coverage per group. Intervention effects are inferred\
  \ where  possible.\nTo model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated\
  \  realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to \
  \ ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform \
  \ a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we  assume\
  \ a 0.5% infection fatality rate and a 3.5:1 ratio of incident hospitalizations\
  \ to deaths. The model assumes that vaccinated individuals have both reductions in susceptibility\
  \ and reductions in hospitalization and mortality. For the two-dose vaccines, one dose has\
  \ an assumed 75% reduction and two doses have a 95% reduction. The one dose J&J vaccine is assumed
  \ to have 70% efficacy.  \nFor each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline\
  \  reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the  effectiveness\
  \ of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an  MCMC-like inference\
  \ procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county  aggregations of incident\
  \ confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA Facts. For the inference of the\
  \ baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical\
  \ grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state.\n\
  Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last\
  \ reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.\nThe estimates reported\
  \ by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g.,\
  \ R0, nationwide spread of more transmissible variants, infectious period,\
  \ time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness\
  \ of state-wide intervention policies  on social distancing, stay-at-home orders,\
  \ and phased reopenings. We submit a single calibration to forecast deaths, cases,\
  \ and hospitalizations."
