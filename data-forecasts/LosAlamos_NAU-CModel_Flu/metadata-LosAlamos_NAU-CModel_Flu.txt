methods: We used a seasonal compartmental model to perform Bayesian analysis on hospitalization data available for each state. The model consists of difference and/or ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of seasonal flu. Our methodology, applied to the COVID-19 disease, was published at doi: 10.3201/eid2703.203364.
