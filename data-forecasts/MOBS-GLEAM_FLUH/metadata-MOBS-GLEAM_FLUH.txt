methods_long: 'This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on
  the assumption  that current interventions continue.  The GLEAM framework is based
  on a metapopulation approach in which the world is divided into geographical subpopulations.
  Human mobility between subpopulations is represented on a network.  This mobility
  data layer identifies the numbers of individuals traveling from one sub-population
  to  another. The mobility network is made up of different kinds of mobility processes,
  from short-range commuting between nearby subpopulations to intercontinental flights.
  To model short-range mobility  such as commuting or car travel, we rely on databases
  collected from the Offices of Statistics of 30  countries on five continents. Superimposed
  on the worldwide population and mobility layers is an  agent-based epidemic model
  that defines the infection and population dynamics. '
