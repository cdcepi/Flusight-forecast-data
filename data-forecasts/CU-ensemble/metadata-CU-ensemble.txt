methods_long: The dynamical model simulates influenza transmission in each state and the US using a humidity-driven SEIRS dynamics. Model variables and parameters are sequentially updated each week using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter and new observations. Forecasts are generated by integrating the optimized model into the future. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model and baseline models use implementations available in the fable R package (ARIMA and RW, respectively). To build ensemble, the quantile distributions of the component models are weighted by the sum of inverse-WIS scores, over last 3 weeks. The 3-week window is target-specific and only includes weeks for which WIS scores could be evaluated (i.e. weights for 4-wk target are calculated with a window further back in time than for 1-wk target). Weights are location-specific and recomputed at each forecast week.
