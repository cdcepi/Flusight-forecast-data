## CDC FluSight Hospitalization Forecasts

This is the data repository for CDC FluSight hospitalization forecasts. 

If you are a modeling team interested in submitting forecasts to this project, please visit our [technical README with detailed submission instructions](./data-forecasts/README.md). Participating teams provide their 
[forecasts](./data-forecasts/) 
in a [quantile-based format](./data-forecasts/README.md#Data-formatting). 


## Data license and reuse
We are grateful to the teams who have generated these and made their data publicly available under different terms and licenses. By default, forecasts are available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, although teams may specify release under a different license in their metadata. You will find the licenses (when provided) within the metadata contained within model-specific folders in the [data-forecasts](./data-forecasts/) directory. Please consult these licenses before using these data to ensure that you follow the terms under which these data were released.
